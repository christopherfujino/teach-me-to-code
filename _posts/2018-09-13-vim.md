## Working with help pages

### `:tab help <filename>`: opens 'filename' in a new tab.
### `<ctrl-w>o`: close all windows except current ('o' for 'only').
### `:tab split`: opens a new tab containing the current buffer.

I found this one because I was looking for a solution to vim's built in help
files always opening in a split. 

## Jump List

### `<c-o>`: jump to previous location
### `<c-i>`: jump forward to next newer location

## Go To File

### `gf`: opens file in the same window (*g*oto *f*ile)
### `<c-w>f`: open in a new window
### `<c-w>gf`: open in a new tab

## Auto-indent

### `=`: verb for auto-indentation
### `=i{`: indent inside curly braces
### `==`: indent current line

## Arbitrary Block Text Object (Test this in Ruby)

### `b`: text object for a block
### `=ib`: indent inside block

In normal mode, vim will determine where the filename starts and ends based on `isfname`.
