## Great Vim Tips

### Working with help pages

`:tab help <filename>`: opens 'filename' help page in a new tab.
`<ctrl-w>o`: close all windows except current ('o' for 'only').
`:tab split`: opens a new tab containing the current buffer.

I found this one because I was looking for a solution to vim's built in help
files always opening in a split, which is helpful if I just want to check
something, but if I want to actually read how a features works, I would
full screen it. If I want to read up on how to use vim tabs, I can type:
`:tab help tab` and then hit tab for auto-complete, and the wildmenu will
suggest `:tab help :tab`, and open it in a new tab.

### Managing Windows

`<c-w>h`: these four navigate around windows
`<c-w>j`
`<c-w>k`
`<c-w>l`
`<c-w>H`: these four move windows around
`<c-w>J`
`<c-w>K`
`<c-w>L`
`<c-w>T`: moves current window into a new tab

### Jump List

`<c-o>`: jump to previous location (move *o*utter in stack)
`<c-i>`: jump forward to next newer location (move *i*nner in stack)

### Go To & Jumps

`gf`: opens file in the same window (*g*oto *f*ile)
`<c-w>f`: open in a new window
`<c-w>gf`: open in a new tab
`<c-]>`: jump to the definition of the keyword under the cursor
`<c-t>`: jump back to the tag
`:tn(ext)`: jump to next tag definition, if multiples exist (*t*ag *n*ext)
`<c-w><c-]>`: open definition in a new window
`g]`: get a list of matching tags

### Auto-indent

`=`: verb for auto-indentation
`=i{`: indent inside curly braces
`==`: indent current line

### Move command

`m3`: *m*ove current line to after line 3
`12,23m$`: *m*ove lines 12 through 23 to after the end of the buffer

### Omni Completion

`<c-x><c-o>`: (insert mode) open omnicomplete (if set)
`<c-n>` or `<c-o>`: next match
`<c-p>`: previous match
