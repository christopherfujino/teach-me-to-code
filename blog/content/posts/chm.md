The [Computer History Museum](https://computerhistory.org/) in the heart of
Silicon Valley is probably my favorite museum. It has an Apple I. It has an
Enigma machine. They have two working IBM 1401 mainframes (you can punch out
a program and run it). They have a replica of the Greek
(Antikythera mechanism)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism]:
a mechanical device made in the 2nd century BC that tracks astronomical objects
for sailors.

I used to work just down the street from the museum. And yet, most of my
co-workers either had no interest in going or had gone once and were bored.
While I can empathize with not being interested in a museum--I have never
been a big fan of them--but I suppose because I am so interested in computers
that learning about those created before I was born that I would never
*actually* want to use is incredibly interesting to me. Also, because I love
computers, I have taken to reading books about them. To then be able to
physically see objects that I have read about is the kind of visceral
experience we're in danger of losing in our modern age.

Recently my wife and I created a smart planter together (we made two YouTube
videos about the process, one for the
[product design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MQyoONSZl8), the other for
the [technical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGE_T_Zt9pQ)). Since we both
enjoy watching retro '80s computing content online (and even had a particular
[earworm-y commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cGh9EeMIY) stuck in
our heads for weeks), we decided to use the Commodore 64 for the aesthetic
inspiration. When we had the planter on display as part of my wife's exhibit
at the Open Sauce maker conference, I thought for sure that the nerdy
demographic there would appreciate the homage. To my surprise, however, few
people seemed to even recognize the similarity. Of the hundreds of people I
talked to over the weekend, I think maybe only four people even mentioned the
Commodore 64, three of which began reminisicing about how their first
introduction to computers was on the Commodore 64.

I have never been particularly nostalgic about my early experiences with
computers. I have fond memories of how exciting computing was to me then,
but I have no desire to actually trade my carefully customized Linux desktop
environment for either the Apple IIGS's primitive text-based
[ProDOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_ProDOS) or its (no doubt at the
time) futuristic GUI environment named
[GS/OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_GS/OS). Where I do have nostalgia
is for '90s home console gaming. In particular, the SNES feels to me like the
pinnacle of 2D sprite-based pixel art gaming.

And yet, probably the top genre of content I consume online is retro
computing, almost all of it from before I was born in 1986. In terms of
programming and software development I love learning about the work that
came out of Bell Labs in the '70s (on this topic, I cannot recommmend highly
enough Brian Kernighan's excellent book *[Unix: A History and a
Memoir](https://www.amazon.com/UNIX-History-Memoir-Brian-Kernighan/dp/1695978552/ref=sr_1_1)*).
In terms of personal computer hardware, I enjoy watching either restoration
videos or personal documentaries about the late '70s to early '80s 8-bit
computers. From a hardware perspective, they are a lot more idiosyncratic
and interesting than the myriad of beige IBM-clones from my childhood. It's
also exciting to see a single person diagnose a broken computer with just a
soldering iron, a multimeter, and maybe a PDF of a scanned schematic.

I wonder if there isn't also some greater principle of growing up/old: the
young look to the future with anticipation, while the old look to the past
for wisdom.
