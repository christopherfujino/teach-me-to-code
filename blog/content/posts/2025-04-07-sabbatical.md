Last month I resigned my position at Google.

I never intended to work at Google for as long as I did. In fact, I never
intended to work at Google in the first place. Without having a formal
computer science background, I assumed that getting a job at a big tech
company was out of the question and so I never even considered whether or not
I would like such a job.

When I was recruited for a role at Google, I knew I had to interview for it,
if for no other reason than that I would always wonder what would it would
have been like. Once I was actually made an offer, I experienced a mixture of
excitement, fear, and apprehension. Obviously, it felt good to be wanted.

But I had a lot of trepidation about working at a big company. And Google was
an even bigger company than I realized. At the time I was working at a small
startup where I knew everyone's name and--even more importantly--I got along
well with everyone.

When I started my new job, I secretly made a goal with myself to stay at the
job for one year. I figured that--sooner or later--one of two things would
happen:

1. I would get fired for "not being a team player" or for being too
frank and speaking my mind in front of the wrong executive; or
1. I would rage
quit, fed up with the corporate bureaucracy or decision-making that placed
profit percentage points over the well-being of people.

I figured, even if I were miserable, I should try to stick it out for at least
a year. I must admit one of my motivations for taking the job was that I knew
it would be a boon on my résumé for the rest of my career. Surely I could
make it one year.

It turns out, I spent 6 years at Google, all on the same team. This unexpected
longevity (if this sounds like sarcasm it is not, in the SF Bay Area 6 years
on the same team is an accomplishment) owes to 2 factors:

1. I was working on an interesting product that I genuinely thought was cool.
I've never publicly talked about how cool it is, because I wouldn't expect
anyone to believe me while I worked there. However, I'm now unemployed, with
no particular vested interest in seeing [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
succeed, yet I will say that it is both incredibly well-engineered and has
a great developer experience. It was also a constant source of interesting
and difficult problems to solve.
1. I was working with a great team of people who were excellent at their job
and who I learned a lot from. And who I enjoyed working with and cared
about.

At the end of the day I became fed up with the corporate bureaucracy and with
decision-making that placed profit percentage points over the well-being of
people. There were some other things that I hadn't anticipated that I also
became fed up with, but it's not my goal to enumerate gripes. In fact, I was
convinced it was necessary for me to leave because I found myself complaining
about work so often.

So I've decided to take a sabbatical.

I'm taking time to detox myself from all the negatives of what I didn't like
about my previous job--and the industry in general--and instead think about
what positive things I can and will do.

Some of the random, not necessarily connected thoughts I've had:

*Technology should empower users. Like a hammer, or even a pencil.*

*Learning should be curiosity-driven. Teaching should be personal.*

*Many moral paradoxes are easily resolved if you're willing to make less
money.*

Privately, an agent can be a father, a friend, an inspiring force in the life of a young man or woman. We are sometimes as important as priests or poets, but until we dedicate ourselves to worthier goals than getting a illegal phone number, we are poets of emptiness.

I have said "later" to most anything that required true sacrifice. Later I will spend a weekend reading real books, not just magazines. Later I will visit my grandmother who is 100 and unable to really know the difference. Later I will visit the clients whose careers are over, but of course I promised to stay in touch. Later later later later. It is too easy to say “later” because we all believe our work to be too important to stop, minute to minute, for something that might interfere with the restless and relentless pursuit of forward motion. Of greater success.
