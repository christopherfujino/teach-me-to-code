Last month I resigned my position at Google.

To put my resignation in some context, I never intended to work at Google for
as long as I did. In fact, I never intended to work at Google in the first
place. Without having a formal computer science background, I assumed that
getting a job at a big tech company was out of the question and so I never
even considered whether or not I would like such a job.

When I was recruited for a role at Google, I knew I had to interview for it,
if for no other reason than that I would always wonder what would it would
have been like. Once I was actually made an offer, I experienced a mixture of
excitement, fear, and apprehension. Obviously, it felt good to be wanted.

But I had a lot of trepidation about working at a big company. And Google was
an even bigger company than I realized. At the time I was working at a small
startup where I knew everyone's name and--even more importantly--I got along
well with everyone.

When I started my new job, I secretly made a goal with myself to stay at the
job for one year. I figured that--sooner or later--one of two things would
happen:

1. I would get fired for "not being a team player" or for being too
frank and speaking my mind in front of the wrong executive; or
1. I would rage
quit, fed up with the corporate bureaucracy or decision-making that placed
profit percentage points over the well-being of people.

I figured, even if I were miserable, I should try to stick it out for at least
a year. I must admit one of my motivations for taking the job was that I knew
it would be a boon on my résumé for the rest of my career. Surely I could
make it one year.

It turns out, I spent 6 years at Google, all on the same team. This unexpected
longevity (if this sounds like sarcasm it is not, in the SF Bay Area 6 years
on the same team is an accomplishment) owes to 2 factors:

1. I was working on an interesting product that I genuinely thought was cool.
I've never publicly talked about how cool it is, because I wouldn't expect
anyone to believe me while I worked there. However, I'm now unemployed, with
no particular vested interest in seeing [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
succeed, yet I will say that it is both incredibly well-engineered and has
a great developer experience. It was also a constant source of interesting
and difficult problems to solve.
1. I was working with a great team of people who were excellent at their job
and who I learned a lot from. And who I enjoyed working with and cared
about.

At the end of the day I became fed up with the corporate bureaucracy and with
decision-making that placed profit percentage points over the well-being of
people. There were some other things that I hadn't anticipated that also made
me fed up, but I'm not writing this to enumerate gripes. In fact, I found
myself complaining about work so much that I didn't like who I was becoming,
and so it seemed necessary for me to quit my job to be the kind of person I
would like to be.

Which is why I've decided to take a sabbatical. To be clear, this is not leave
granted by my employer; I resigned my position and am definitely unemployed.
Neither am I looking for a job. Before I decided on taking a sabbatical, I
*did* look at other jobs. However, I had the sinking feeling that it would be
more of the same. I've never been one to hop from one rock to the next, just
because I'm tired of the previous rock.

I'm taking time to detox myself from all the negatives of what I didn't like
about my previous job--and the industry in general--and instead think about
what positive things I can and will do.

Some of the random, not necessarily
connected thoughts I've had:

*Technology should empower users. Technology should be a tool like a
hammer, or even a pencil.*

*Learning should be curiosity-driven. Teaching should be personal.*

*Greatness can be achieved if you're willing to settle for less money.*
