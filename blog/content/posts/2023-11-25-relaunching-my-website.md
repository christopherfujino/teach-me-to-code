Since my [last post]({{< relref "/posts/2016-10-13-sfjs.md" >}}) over 7 years
ago(!), I have always had it in the back of my mind that I would like to get
back to blogging. In that time, coding went from a hobby I was interested in
growing in to my full-time profession (see my
[résumé]({{< relref "/resume.md" >}}) for more details on what I've been up
to).

## Refreshing the Tech Stack

My [first post]({{< relref "/posts/2016-06-15-hello-world" >}}) was primarily
about the criteria I used to select a static site generator:
[hexo](https://hexo.io). I think this was short-lived however, and can
remember porting this site to Jekyll and Hugo over the years. As the last of
these ports were to Hugo, I decided to stick with that for now and focus on
putting some polish on it.

Previously, the presentation was incredibly minimal, with just a link in the
