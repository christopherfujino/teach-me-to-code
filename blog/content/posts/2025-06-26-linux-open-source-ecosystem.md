title: On Open Source Ecosystems

I'm writing this in June of 2025, not long after Xorg has been
[forked](https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-devel/2025-June/059400.html) as the
XLibre project. However, this is not intended as a topical post related to
current events; if I were to attempt to predict the future, I would guess that
by 2027 the XLibre project will be defunct and forgotten. Instead, what is of
interest to me is the nature of open source ecosystems.

I first made the transition from Windows to Linux as my daily driver in 2012
(I have fond memories of Ubuntu 12.04 with its beautiful purple Unity desktop
environment). Even then, before I knew what a distribution or a display server
or a window manager or screen tearing was, I knew that linux nerds hated the
obsolete X11 server and that Wayland was going to be the future and would
solve all our problems...if it were ever production ready.
