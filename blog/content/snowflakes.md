I don't find years of experience to be effective at establishing a programmer's technical expertise...at least before an online rant.

Certainly, I would expect someone with 30 years of experience to have some technical expertise (of course there are exceptions). However, software is so broad AND deep, that I don't know if 200 years of full-time work experience would be enough to be a general-purpose software expert.

In other words, having N years of experience tells me little about the particular topic the person is about to rant about, and I feel like as engineers we are prone to be overconfident about the things we hate.

We are all special, having made our own unique trail through the wild jungle of software complexity.
