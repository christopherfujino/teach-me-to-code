This is my blog about my personal journey in learning programming & web
development. It is an outlet for me to process and communicate what Iâ€™m
learning, and also an opportunity to interact with other coders.

I am excited about clean code, open source software, and learning/teaching. I
love refactoring code, run applications in Docker, and streamline my vim config.
